"Malik is a 49 year old man from Gilgit Baltistan area. He had a lot of "
"doubts about Islam that led him to explore Christianity. He shared that he "
"had a very hard time finding evidence of any miracles Mohammad performed. "
"One of the popular miracles Mohammad performed was splitting the moon in "
"half. The more he looked into the history of this event the more "
"disappointment he felt. No one had recorded this event to be true in "
"history. On the other hand, the miracles Jesus performed had countless "
"witnesses and had been acknowledged throughout history. His Christian friend "
"told him about Jesus’ authority to perform these miracles. Malik learned "
"Jesus not only healed people but he also forgave sins. He was eager to learn "
"what more Jesus could do and as he learned about Jesus’ authority it became "
"clear to him he needed to follow Jesus. He prayed for his salvation and "
"became a follower of Jesus Christ. Pray for Malik as there are many others "
"who are exposed to Christianity but need guidance to lead them in the right "
"direction. Pray for him to grow in his faith and lead others who are in "
"search of the truth. "

"non seulement Jésus a guéri les gens, mais il a aussi pardonné leurs péchés. "
"Il était avide de savoir d’autres choses que Jésus pouvait faire et pendant "

"Mahmoud is a young man from Upper Egypt whose family lives in a small "

"the family. On his first vist to Cairo, he met his uncle, for whom he was "
"going to work. His uncle put him to work all day and as the day ended, he "
"thought he would go home with his uncle to his family. Instead, his uncle "
"locked him in a dark room above his suit factory. Mahmoud was afraid and sat "
"in a corner with his legs pulled up against his chest and arms wrapped "
"tightly around them. He sat up crying all night, and all he could see was "
"some light coming through holes in the roof that illuminated the rats "
"crawling around the rafters. He would finally sleep as the sun came up, then "
"his uncle would open the door and let him out to work another twelve hours.\n"
"\n"
"When Mahmoud returned home, he was so traumatized he fell asleep on his mat "

"end of the week his father took him to the imam who told the family he had "
"evil spirits in him. He charged the family a larger amount of money and "

"allait travailler. Son oncle l’a fait travailler toute la journée et pendant "
"que le jour décline, il a pensé que l’oncle allait l’amener dans sa famille. "
"Au lieu de cela, l’oncle l’a enfermé dans une chambre à l’étage de son usine "
"de fabrication de vestes où il faisait sombre. Pris de peur, Mahmoud s’était "
"assis dans un coin, les jambes recroquevillées jusqu’à la poitrine et les "

"pleurer tout au long de la nuit, et la seule chose qu’il pouvait voir, c’"

"A la fin de la semaine, son père l’a pris et l’a amené auprès de l’imam qui "

"prayed, it was the first time I felt peace in my entire tumultuous life -- I "
"looked at this man as he prayed, and I could see this overwhelming peace and "
"joy, and I wanted it. As he finished praying, I heard him say in Urdu, \"in "
"Jesus' name, Amen.\" I knew then there must be some connection to Jesus and "
"this guy's peace and joy. In the coming weeks, that man led me to Christ, "
"and then I led my family to Christ. We moved back to Afghanistan a couple "
"years later, and by the grace of God we saw many Afghans come to faith in "
"Christ, some even who are still in Afghanistan and remain a light under the "
"current regime.\n"
"\n"
"Please pray for the persecuted church in Afghanistan:\n"
"- to love their enemies\n"
"- to be filled with love and boldness to share the gospel, heal the sick and "
"cast out demons\n"
"- to multiply disciples, churches, and leaders among every people and place "
"in that country"

"I am a thirty-year-old man from Tunisia. I was raised in a strict, "
"practicing Muslim family. The first time I went to a church building, I had "
"a government job to watch the Christians. I was surprised by their simple "
"message and wondered why we were afraid of them. One day the Christians gave "
"me a Bible and explained it to me. They prayed for me. I went home and "
"prayed, “God, you know me. If you are true, speak to me.” I had a dream. "
"There were six people being crucified on a cross. The Messiah was also on a "
"cross. My friend from the police gave me a gun and said to shoot them. The "
"Messiah said, “I will never die,” and then he pointed to the others, “They "
"will not die either.” I woke up and called my friend in the dream. He had "
"had the same dream! I understand that only the Messiah offers eternal life "
"and that is why Christians are not afraid. I gave my life to Christ.\n"
